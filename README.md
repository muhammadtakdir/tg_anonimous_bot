Create a telegram bot via @BotFather and note the token. replace it in config.py.

When trying this, I used python 3.12.0 on the windows 10 platform. But please try using other operating systems. run on your teminal, pip install "python-telegram-bot==20.5" to install telegram library. 

after python is installed, just run it with the python main.py command. wait for others to send messages to bot. just select message and touch reply to reply message from the other.
