Create a telegram bot via @BotFather and note the token. replace it in config.py.

When trying this, I used python 3.12.0 on the windows 10 platform. But please try using other operating systems.

after python is installed, just run it with the python main.py command. Then open the bot name. And /start. to see the telegram id number type /id, to reply to a message from a user, /balas <user_id_number> <message>
